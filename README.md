nf software, originally written in the 1980s, with a stable version done in 1988

This repository is a snapshot of the nf folder on the kozik6 PC that has been actively
running on the same PC (updated from MSDOS, Win31, Win95, WinXP) as an MSDOS program.

The original MSDOS software wouldn't run on Windows 7.  And thus an end to this software.  
This repository is an inactive archive.  I have another repository that holds the rewritten
version of this software, but written in PHP/JS/JQuery, running on an Apache server on 
my Win7 PC.

Some historical notes:
/src - command line version of nf
/newsrc - rewritten nf to run in a curses based MS-DOS window.  Rooted in my UNIX/LINUX backgroud
/srcpp - C++ version
/jev - windows
